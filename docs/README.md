## Managing inventory
Inventory is the quantity of a particular product that is available for sale.

Inventory tracking can help you avoid selling products that have run out of stock, or let you know when you need to order or make more of your product. You can set up inventory tracking, view your inventory, and adjust your inventory levels in the Inventory area of Shopify. You can also view the history of inventory adjustments for products and variants whose inventory is being tracked by Shopify.

You can analyze changes to inventory levels in the Inventory Reports section of Shopify.

### Best Practices
To avoid confusion, be sure to include the following for each item you add to your Shopify online inventory.
* Use the same name as you are currently using for each item in Rec Trac
* Add the Rec Trac ID number to the SKU field in Shopify
* Enter the correct tax code for each item. Codes found [here](https://taxcode.avatax.avalara.com)
* Merchandise listed for sale online should be physically stored separately from the in-person shop inventory. **DO NOT** take the inventory out of Rectrac!
* Carefully follow the instructions for entering inventory into the Shopify system.
* Always protect the integrity of the physical inventory for online sales. The customer’s credit card is charged at the time of their purchase in Shopify, making it much more complicated to cancel or refund a sale, and we never want to be in the position of telling a customer they have paid for an item we do not have to send them.
* Be sure to update the Shopify inventory if ANY changes other than through Shopify sales are made to the items physically stored for online sales.
* Be sure to include merchandise weight when entering details in Shopify. Weight the largest size if the item is offered in multiple sizes and use that weight for all sizes of the same style. Be sure to do this for each different type of product – for instance long sleeve tees, short sleeve tees, v-neck tees, sweatshirts, hoodies, etc.

### Getting started with inventory
Store inventory represents the number of each product variant that you have available to sell. Inventory levels are affected by how you set up your products and your fulfillment process. You can track and manage your store's inventory levels in the Inventory area of Shopify.

In this section, you will learn how to set up inventory tracking in Shopify, import or export your inventory quantities, and hide or sell products that are out of stock.

**Steps**
1. From your Shopify admin, go to Products.
2. Click the name of the product that you want to track.
3. If the product has variants, then click the variant that you want to track.
4. In the Inventory section, check Track quantity.
5. If you want to allow customers to purchase the item when it's out of stock, then check Continue selling when out of stock.
6. In the Quantity section, enter the quantity information for each location.
7. Click Save.

### Viewing your product inventory
You can view product inventory on the Products page, which displays a combined inventory count for all the variants of each product.

You can view the inventory counts for your product variants on the Inventory page. On the Inventory page, you can search variants, filter or sort by different criteria, or change the sort order. You can also add tags to your products to help with inventory management.

### Adjusting inventory quantities
You can change the available inventory quantity of products in the following ways:
* on the Inventory page
* for product with variants, on the product details page
* using the bulk editor
* using the inventory CSV file
You can also use the inventory barcode scanner on a mobile device to add barcodes for your products.

If a product's inventory quantity is tracked using inventory apps, then its quantities will be allocated only to that app location. You can change the locations products are assigned to.

When you have multiple locations, a location filter appears in the Shopify admin on pages and sections where it applies, such as the Orders page and the Inventory page. When you select a location in the filter, the page keeps your selection until you change it. The selected location for a page is stored in a browser cookie, so it isn’t maintained between devices or browsers.

**Steps**
1. In the Shopify admin, go to Products > Inventory.
2. If you have multiple locations, then select a location from the drop down menu.
3. Optional: Filter or search the list of products.
4. You can adjust the available quantity of a single variant or multiple variants by the same amount.
  * To adjust a single variant, enter the quantity in the Available column of the variant that you want to adjust.
  * To adjust multiple variants by the same amount, select the variants you want to edit and click More actions > Update quantity.
5. Click Save. The new total is in the Available column.


## Adding and updating products
You can add or update information about a product such as its price, variants, and availability from the Products page in your Shopify admin.

If you want to save specialized information or files for your products, then you can add custom fields to your product pages by using Metafields. If you have an Online Store 2.0 theme, then you can add references to your product Metafields through the theme editor.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qks-MlwP6c4

**Steps**
1. From your Shopify admin, go to Products.
2. From the Products page, click Add product.
3. Enter a title for your product, along with additional details.
4. Click Save.



### Duplicate a Product
To save time when you add a new product, you can duplicate a similar product. If you want to add options to an existing product, such as color or size, then add a variant to the product instead of duplicating the product.

When you duplicate a product, you have the option to copy one or more of the following product details:
* images
* SKUs
* barcodes
* inventory quantity
If you leave the options unselected, then these product details are left blank in the duplicate. Other product details except 3D models and videos are copied from the original to the duplicate.

By default, the duplicate product's status is set as draft, and hidden on all your channels and apps. The duplicated product isn't available to sales channels until you change its status as active. You have the option to make the duplicate available to the same channels and apps as the original product. In this case, depending on the sales channel, the duplicate product may be published immediately after it's created.

**Steps**
1. From your Shopify admin, go to Products.
2. Click the name of the product that you want to duplicate.
3. Click Duplicate.
4. Enter a name for the duplicate product, and then click Duplicate product.
5. Modify the product details.
6. Optional: Make the duplicate product available to the same channels and apps as the original. When the product status is set as active, depending on the sales channel, the duplicate product may be published immediately after it's created.


### Edit a product
After you've created products, you can edit them to change their descriptions, prices, and any other product details.

Although you can change your product details at any time, the changes can affect your reports. For information on how the changes can affect the way that products appear and are grouped in your reports, see Changes to product details.

Saved changes take effect immediately in your online store. Before you update a product, you can check the top of the page to see if another staff might also be making changes to the same product.

**Steps**
1. From your Shopify admin, go to Products.
2. Click the name of the product that you want to change.
3. Modify the product details.
4. Click Save.


## Collections
You can group your products into collections to make it easier for customers to find them by category. Here are a few examples of collections that you might create:
* clothes for men, women, or children
* items of a certain type, such as lamps, cushions, or rugs
* items on sale
* items in a certain size or color
* seasonal products, such as holiday cards and decorations

After you create a collection, it can be shown on your online store as a webpage with a gallery of the products that are in the collection. Your customers can then click a product image on the collection page to visit a specific product's page. You can help customers find and view collections by adding links to the collections in a menu in your store's navigation.

The exact layout and appearance of collection pages depends on your theme.

You can view, create, and edit collections from the Collections page of your Shopify admin.

[![What Are Collections?](https://img.youtube.com/vi/HigPf0MCMLA/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HigPf0MCMLA)

### Collection types
You can create two types of collections:

An automated collection uses selection conditions to automatically include matching products. You can add up to 60 selection conditions. You can also specify whether products need to meet all of the conditions or any of the conditions to be included in the collection. When you add a new product that matches the selection conditions for a collection, the product is automatically added to the collection.

Automated collections are usually preferred because, after you set up the conditions, future products are added automatically. You can save a lot of time by using automated collections if you have a large selection of products or if you have seasonal or rotating inventories. For example, suppose that you run an apparel store. If you tag all your products with a seasonal tag, such as summer or fall, then all your seasonal attire can automatically be included in the matching collection.

One drawback to creating an automated collection is that you can't remove particular products from it unless you change the collection's conditions or edit the product details so that they no longer match the conditions.

A manual collection includes only the products that you choose individually. Because of this, the collection always contains the same products unless you specifically add or remove products.

Manual collections take more work to maintain, but can be a good choice for small or specialized collections that you intend to curate personally. For example, if you plan to hold a one-time flash sale of just a few products, then you can create a manual collection for them and set up a discount for just the products in that collection.

After you create a collection, you can't change its type.

#### Automated collections
An automated collection uses selection conditions to automatically include matching products. You can add up to 60 selection conditions, and you can specify whether products need to meet all conditions or any condition to be included in the collection.

If you want to choose specific products for a collection, then you can create a manual collection instead.


#### Manual collections
A manual collection includes the specific products that you choose. The collection will always contain the same products unless you add or remove them. Before you update a collection, you can check the top of the page to see if another staff might also be making changes to the same collection.

Create a manual collection
You can create a manual collection and add products to the collection. If the collection is available to your online store, then you can change the order in which the products are displayed from the collection page. If you don't want to publish the collection as soon as you create it, then you can set a specific date when the collection will be published to your online store. 

[![Create A Manual Collection](https://img.youtube.com/vi/DMZnywUDYcE/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMZnywUDYcE)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMZnywUDYcE

**Steps**
1. From your Shopify admin, go to Products > Collections.
2. Click Create collection.
3. Enter a title and description for the collection.
4. In the Collection type section, click Manual.
5. Click Save.
6. In the Products section, search for products or click Browse, and then add the products that you want to have in the collection.
7. Set the sort order for how you want the products to be sorted in your store. For more information about sorting, see Change the sort order for the products in a collection.
8. Optional: The Search engine listing preview section shows a preview of how the collection will be displayed in search results. If you want to edit this information, then click Edit website SEO. You can't change the URL and handle, because they are used to link the collection to your online store.
9. In the Sales channels section, click Manage to select the sales channels where you want your collection to be available.
10. In the Collection image section, click Add image to upload an image for the collection. For information about the sizes of images that you can use, see Image sizes.
11. Click Save.
12. Add a link to your collection in your online store navigation so that customers can find and view the collection.

### Add products to a manual collection
1. From your Shopify admin, go to Products > Collections.
2. Click the name of the collection that you want to add products to.
3. In the Products section, search for products or click Browse, and then add the products that you want to have in the collection.

## Product Media
Product media can include images, 3D models, and videos. Using media like 3D models for your products provides your customer with a better understanding of the function and size of an item, and increases your customers' confidence in the quality of your products.

You can add product media directly to your product pages, or by using Metafields. If you have an Online Store 2.0 theme, such as Dawn, the free Shopify theme, then you can add references to your product Metafields through the theme editor.

### Adding product media
You can add up to 250 images, 3D models, or videos to a product.

The first media item for each product is known as the featured, or main, media item. The main media item is shown on collection pages, the cart page, the checkout page, and your home page.

**Steps** 
1. From your Shopify admin, go to Products.
2. Click a product to see its details page.
3. Add an image, 3D model, or video in one of the following ways:
  * Click Add and then select the file that you want to upload.
  * Drag and drop the file that you want to upload onto the Media section.
  * Click Add media from URL, and then enter the image URL, or video URL of the product hosted on YouTube or Vimeo.

### Adding alt text to media
Alt (alternative) text describes a media item and is an important part of a product description. If a media item can't load for any reason, then alt text is shown instead. It's also used by assistive technology to describe an image to a customer who's visually impaired. Including alt text can boost your website's SEO.

Keep your alt text brief and descriptive. The maximum length is 512 characters, but 125 or less is recommended.

**Steps**
1. From your Shopify admin, go to Products.
2. Click the name of the product that you want to edit.
3. From the product details page, click a product media item to see the Preview media page.
4. Click Add ALT text.
5. Enter your alt text, and then click Save ALT text.
6. Click the X to exit the preview page.

### Taking product photographs
Using high quality product photographs on your store demonstrates to your customers what they'll get if they buy your products. Your online store looks more professional with good quality product photography, and it can increase customer trust in your brand.

### Product details
The details that you provide for a product affect the way that the product is displayed to customers, make it easier for you to organize your products, and help customers find the product. You don't have to provide every detail for each product.

For products that don't have any variants, the Pricing, Inventory, and Shipping sections are shown on the product details page. If you add variants, then those sections are no longer shown on the product details page. To change the details for product variants, refer to Editing variants for an existing product.

If you want to save specialized information or files for your products, then you can add custom fields to your product pages by using Metafields. If you have an Online Store 2.0 theme, such as Dawn, then you can use the theme editor to connect Metafields to your theme and customize your pages to the product or variant that's displayed.

#### Title and description
* **Title** - The name for your product that you want to display to your customers.

* **Description** - The description for your product. This area uses the rich text editor so that you can format your text. Describe your products in detail to inform and persuade your potential customers. If you're a reseller, then don't use a manufacturer's exact description, because you want your products to be unique to search engines.

#### Pricing
* **Price** - The price that you're charging for the product. You set the currency on the General settings page. If you are selling in multiple currencies, then click Available in other currencies. Manage currencies to view your currency settings. Click Charge taxes on this product if the product is taxable.

* **Compare at price** - The original price for a product that is on sale. When you enter a compare at price, the product displays a sale price.

* **Tax code** - For Shopify Plus plans, you can use a third-party tax service. If you use the service, then the tax code for the product is shown here.

* **Cost per item** - How much it costs you for the product or variant. For example, if you resell a product, then you can enter the price that you paid the manufacturer, excluding taxes, shipping, or other costs. If you create the product yourself, then you can enter a value that is based on your labor and material costs.

For products that have a product cost entered—unless you include taxes in your prices—the projected margin is shown below the **Price** field on the product details page. The margin is calculated as ([price - cost] / price) * 100). For example, if your price is $50 and your cost is $30, then the margin (calculated as ([50 - 30] / 50) * 100) is 40%.

If your store is on the Shopify plan or higher, then you can access reports to analyze your product costs and margins. You can also find your cost of goods sold (COGS).

Entering the cost per item is optional. If you choose to enter your costs, then add the amounts to all your existing products at the same time by using the bulk editor or a CSV import. By updating the information at the same time, you can get the most value out of your profit reports.

Cost per item doesn't apply to gift card products.

#### Inventory
* **SKU (stock keeping unit)** - The code that identifies the product within your business. For effective tracking and sales reporting, each SKU needs to be unique.

SKUs are optional. You can create your own SKU format. For more information about SKUs, refer to SKU formats.

* **Barcode (ISBN, UPC, GTIN, etc.)** - Barcodes are typically used by resellers. The identifier needs to be a new or existing Global Trade Item Number (GTIN). Some sales channels require a GTIN before a product can be published using the channel.

GTINs are unique identifiers used internationally to store and locate product information. UPC, EAN, and ISBN numbers are examples of GTINs, which might vary in length depending on the product type. You can find the GTIN above or below the barcode on the packaging for your product.

The barcode is used by Shopify POS in a retail store, for publishing products using the Google channel.

If you don't have a GTIN for a product, then you can request it from the manufacturer. Learn how to get a GTIN for a product you manufacture at the GS1 standards website. Don't invent false GTIN information for your products.

For information on how to enter barcodes by using your smartphone, refer to Scan a barcode with your device's camera.

* **Inventory policy** - The setting for inventory tracking.

* **Available** - The number of units in stock. If you are managing your inventory across multiple locations, then the quantity is shown for each location.

* **Incoming** - The number of incoming units. Refer to Transfers.

* **Committed** - The number of units that are part of an order but aren't yet fulfilled. Inventory units that are part of draft orders aren't counted as committed until the draft order becomes an order.

#### Shipping
* **This is a physical product** - The setting for whether a product needs to be shipped. Uncheck it for digital products or services, or for products that you never ship.

* **Weight** - The product's actual weight. This field only appears when This is a physical product is checked. Product weight needs to be exact because it is used to calculate shipping rates. You can buy a shipping scale at the Shopify Hardware Store.

* **Country/Region of origin** - The country where the product was manufactured or assembled. If the product consists of materials from different countries or regions, then the country or region where it takes its essential form is the country or region of origin. Different countries or regions and international treaties have different rules of origin.

* **HS code** - If you want to ship the product internationally, then enter the harmonized system (HS) tariff code. These codes provide customs with information so that correct tariffs can be applied to the order. You can find the HS code for your product by searching using a keyword in the HS code field of the product details page. Learn more about HS codes from the World Customs Organization.

* **Fulfillment service** - Select a fulfillment service from the list of the ones that you are using. If you're not using a fulfillment service, then select Shopify.

## Shipping
### Preparing Merchandise for Shipping
1. Print shipping labels and packing slips from Shopify – keep these two documents together for each order throughout this process.
2. Pull items for each packing slip from the designated online (Shopify) merchandise area. Check twice to make sure the items you pulled are the exact items (size, color, print, etc.) indicated on the packing slip.
3. You will choose packaging materials based on the shipping method selected by the customer and indicated on the shipping label.
4. Box items, be sure to carefully wrap any breakables. As you pack the box/envelope check items against the packing slip one more time. 
5. Insert the packing slip and thank you note (and for Waco Welcome Center, our Visitor Guide) before sealing the package.
6. Apply the label to the package for shipping. 
7. Notify the shipping company to pick up the package. (Susan will check to see if this is automatically done through Shipping Easy) Check during actual online transaction.
8. Mark the transaction as complete in Shopify.
9. Complete each order individually. Do not attempt to work on more than one order at a time!
